# phase_1_Toyproblems
Toy problems consists of three questions.
1. Student Grade Generator
2. Speed Detector
3. Net Salary Calculator

STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR
Here we are supposed to come up with a function that prompts the user to input marks between 0 and 100,
and output the grade acquired by the student. 
I used if else if statements to return the grade in accordance to the marks input. This is in index.js
The biggest challenge i had was to get the prompt function right.

SPEED DETECTOR
In this challenge it is expected that the program would take in the speed input and calculate whether the traffic user was going over the speed limit or not.
if the user was over the limit by less than 12 points then the return should print out the number of demerit points.
however if above 12 points it should print out "license suspended"
In index1.js i used the if else statement and nested one if else statement whereby if the demerit points were above 12 it gave the expected return.

NET SALARY CALCULATOR
In this, the expectation is a program that accepts input of salary and benefits then calculates the net salary,
expected PAYE NSSF and NHIF deductions
In index2.js using if else if statements to ensure tax rate for the different salary range was correctly defined.

RESOURCES
In the completion of this challenge i used various resources. such as.
